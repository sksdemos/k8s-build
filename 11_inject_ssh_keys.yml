# This Playbook injects SSH public key into all k8s VMs and readies them for Ansible access

# ASSUMPTIONS:
# Requires prior libvirt network configuration to make this/these VM/s accessible from the host
# This playbook creates a user ans sets the password on the designated VMs. Ansible will use SSH to connect to this user
# These SSH user name and password can be changed in the configs/password.yml
#
# NOTE: This step is necessary for further ansible related provisioning on the designated VMs
